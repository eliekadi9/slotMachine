🧠 Project Overview
This Slot Machine game was built using Java Swing, a GUI toolkit for developing interactive desktop applications. The aim of the project was to deepen my understanding of event-driven programming, GUI development, and state management in a game setting.

🔧 How It Works
• Players begin by entering a deposit amount.
• Clicking “Start Playing” launches the slot machine interface.
• Each play deducts a bet from the balance and spins the reels.
• If a winning combination appears, the user receives a payout based on the match.
• The game continues until the balance is depleted or the player decides to stop.
💡 Why This Project?
• To practice building responsive, multi-step GUI applications with Java Swing.
• To implement randomization, payout logic, and balance management.
• To simulate a real-world game scenario involving user input and feedback.
